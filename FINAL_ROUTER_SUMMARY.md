# 🎯 Router MCP - Final Implementation Summary

## **What You Need: UID-Based Router with Session Management + Profile Access**

✅ **Pass UID every time** → Router tracks conversations  
✅ **Access profiles table** → Get credit card, name, address automatically  
✅ **Session persistence** → Conversations survive across interactions  

## 🔧 **Your Main Chatbot Integration**

```python
# Every time an LLM calls your Router MCP:
response = await router_mcp_client.call_tool(
    "route_commerce_message_with_profiles",
    user_id=current_user.id,    # ← UID from auth.users
    message=user_message
)
```

## 🗃️ **What Router MCP Does Automatically**

### 1. **Session Management**
```python
# Router creates/finds session using UID
session_key = f"{user_id}_{service}"  # e.g., "user123_dominos"

# Stores in Supabase:
{
    "user_id": "user123",
    "service": "dominos", 
    "message_history": [...],  # Full conversation
    "user_profile": {...}      # Profile data cached
}
```

### 2. **Profile Access** 
```python
# Router queries your profiles table
profile = supabase.table("profiles").select("*").eq("id", user_id).execute()

# Gets: name, address, phone, credit card info, etc.
```

### 3. **Enhanced Context to Claude**
```
System Prompt: "You are a Domino's assistant...

CUSTOMER PROFILE:
- Name: John Smith
- Phone: (555) 123-4567
- Address: 123 Main St, NYC
- Payment: Visa ending in 1234

The user said: 'I want pizza'"
```

## 🎉 **User Experience**

**Without UID/Profiles:**
```
User: "I want pizza"
🤖: "What's your address? Phone? Payment method?"
```

**With UID/Profiles (Your Setup):**
```
User: "I want pizza"  
🤖: "Hi John! Large pepperoni to 123 Main St? I'll charge your Visa ending in 1234. Total: $15.99?"
```

## 📁 **Ready-to-Use Files**

### `router_profiles_enhanced.py` ✅
- **Main tool**: `route_commerce_message_with_profiles(user_id, message)`
- **Session management**: Automatic conversation tracking
- **Profile integration**: Queries your profiles table
- **Multi-user isolation**: Each UID gets separate sessions

### Your Integration:
```python
# In your main chatbot
class MainChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.router_mcp = MCPClient("router_profiles_enhanced.py")
    
    async def handle_message(self, user_id: str, message: str):
        if self.is_commerce(message):
            # Pass UID → Router handles everything
            return await self.router_mcp.call_tool(
                "route_commerce_message_with_profiles",
                user_id=user_id,
                message=message
            )
        else:
            return await self.general_assistant(message)
```

## 🔄 **Complete Flow**

1. **User says**: "I want pizza"
2. **Main chatbot passes**: `user_id="john123"`, `message="I want pizza"`
3. **Router MCP**:
   - Queries: `SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = 'john123'`
   - Creates/continues session for john123_dominos
   - Enhances context with profile data
   - Calls Claude with Domino's MCP + profile context
4. **Claude responds**: "Hi John! Pizza to your usual address?"
5. **Session saved**: Full conversation stored in Supabase
